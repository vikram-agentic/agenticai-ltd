# Email Setup Guide for Contact Form

This guide will help you set up email functionality for the contact form using **Resend** - a reliable, free email service.

## ðŸŽ¯ What We've Built

âœ… **Complete Contact Form System**:
- Contact form submissions stored in Supabase database
- Automatic email notifications to `info@agentic-ai.ltd`
- Automatic acknowledgment emails to users
- Admin dashboard integration for managing submissions
- Real-time status tracking

## ðŸ“§ Email Service Setup

### Step 1: Sign Up for Resend (Free)

1. Go to [Resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address
4. **Free Tier**: 3,000 emails/month, 100 emails/day

### Step 2: Get Your API Key

1. In your Resend dashboard, go to **API Keys**
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Give it a name like "Agentic AI Contact Form"
4. Copy the API key (starts with `re_...`)

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.local` file:
```env
# Email Service (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
```

### Step 4: Set Up Supabase Secrets

```bash
npx supabase secrets set RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
```

### Step 5: Verify Domain (Optional but Recommended)

1. In Resend dashboard, go to **Domains**
2. Add your domain: `agentic-ai.ltd`
3. Follow the DNS verification steps
4. This ensures emails come from your domain instead of `@resend.dev`

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### When a User Submits the Contact Form:

1. **Form Data Validation**: Validates required fields and email format
2. **Database Storage**: Saves submission to `contact_submissions` table
3. **Admin Notification**: Sends email to `info@agentic-ai.ltd` with all details
4. **User Acknowledgment**: Sends thank you email to the user
5. **Status Tracking**: Logs email success/failure in database
